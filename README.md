# Get the perfect README

## Description

- I love making node based products that can serve a real world purpose!
- I chose to create a readme generator because I wanted to challenge myself in a new area and see how well I know Node and Inquirer.
- I desided to create a readme generator to practice my backend knowledge and see how well I can path between multiple files
- By making this I learned how to use Node, Inquire, a better understanding of arrays, and multiple packages.
